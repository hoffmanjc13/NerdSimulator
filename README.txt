Nerd Simulator Bowl is a game based on Sciencebowl, a science-themed trivia game. The name is a play on National Sciencebowl, mostly so I  could use the NSB logo. The game reads you practice question sets from the DOEâ€™s website and let you play against AI opponents. Additionally, I added an optional bonus question type based on drawing, wherein players will be asked to draw a molecule and will be automatically graded on it.

To run Nerd Simulator Bowl, run the file called NerdSimulatorBowl.py. The only required modules are cmu_112_graphics, which is included with the files, and the python standard library, which you hopefully already have. If users want more rounds, additional sets can be found here: https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb/Regional-Competitions/Resources/HS-Sample-Questions. It is worth noting that I do not guarantee that any set from after 2010 will work without modifiying pdfParser.py. That said, if you want to add the anyways, simply download the files into the questionSets directory and ensure that they have a unique round number (ex. renaming 2007's round 1 to be round17.pdf). Then you can simply access the new sets like normal.

P.S. If you're wondering why I didn't use pyPDF2 instead of writing my own (terrible) parser, the answer is it was for a school project.
